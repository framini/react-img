# react-img

React component for rendering images in a performant and good looking way. This is heavily inspired by [gatsby-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image) but it only includes the React layer, which means, it doesn't include any built-in solutions for generating image sources. The main purpose of this package is to provide the same great UX provided by `gatsby-images` but leaving the task of providing the image sources to the consumer.

```
